These past years, populism has received great attention from social scientists and political commentators [@mudde2004populist; @panizza2005populism]. The term ‘populism’  is both widely used and disputed [@roberts2006populism; @barr2009populists]. Several scientists have taken on the challenge of conceptualising populism with only a small number of widely acknowledged characteristics. Often, the concept is broken down to political, economic, social, and discursive features and analyzed from numerous theoretical perspectives including democratic and modernization theory, social movement theory, party politics and political psychology [@postel2007populist; @goodliffe2012resurgence; @acemoglu2013political]. Within the wide range of literature there is a general agreement that populism is context-dependent and culture-bound, therefore strongly variable across countries. By the means of cross-national analyses, @mudde2012populism were able to gain extensive insight into populism and democracy in Latin America, Canada, Eastern and Western Europe. Further scholars differentiate populism based on historical periods with studies using data going back to the late 19th century [@arter2010breakthrough; @rosenthal2012steep; @levitsky2013resurgence]. Furthermore, populism cuts across ideological cleavages [@kaltwasser2014responses]: in Europe, an exclusionary right-wing variant of populism emerged in the 1980s—and has intensified since—targeting mostly immigrants and national minorities [@mudde2007populist; @ivarsflaten2008unites; @art2011inside; @berezin2013normalization]. Finding common traits which combine various populist activites across several countries remains a great challenge. The task therefore is to explain how specific circumstances and culture nature populists politics and how these in turn impact the political sphere [@arter2010breakthrough]. Despite such difficulties, it is possible to conceptualise populism by clearly identifing the key features of the phenomenon to be observed, allowing a comparison of populist politics across contexts.jhkhkhhk
