# How to use this?

Well this is a quit compressed version of a fully functional \LateX template for R-Markdown. The main file is `paper_voting.Rmd`. Everytime you want to compile the whole document there you are. It bears all the header meta information and sources the other `.Rmd`into one final document. All first level header (`section`) are also in this file. If you want to include images this is very easy done by `![](imgaes/logo_stuttgart.jpg)`. All kind of citation variances can be found in the final `paper_voting.PDF` (compiled).
