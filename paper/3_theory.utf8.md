Zunächst Political participation beleuchten konzepte usw....literatur vetter

Populist politics can reshape repertoires of political mobilization, especially in the forms of mass social movements and socially engaged party organizations [@hawkins2010venezuela; @jansen2011populist]. The ability of populist politics to galvanize new forms of political engagement is especially important in an era of decline in formal political participation such as turnout and party membership @skocpol2016tea. At the same time, in unconsolidated democracies populism may erode democratic institutions and usher competitive authoritarian regimes [@levistky2012populism].


Voting is only one form of political participation. There are many other ways in which citizens can get involved in the political process. Once this is recognized, the challenge is to clarify what we mean by political participation, what activities are and are not covered by the concept. [@brady1995beyond, p. 38] provide the standard definition of political participation. For them, it refers to *"activity that has the intent or effect of influencing government action - either directly by affecting the making or implementation of public policy or indirectly by influencing the selection of people who make those policies."* They also specify that they focus on voluntary activity that is, not obligatory and unpaid. 3 In practice, this amounts to, beyond electoral activity (voting and campaigning), contacting government officials, being active in groups that attempt to influence governments, and being involved in protests and demonstrations [@blais2010political].


## Voting Right-Wing Parties

Whether or not this fear is justified, the fact remains that many countries have witnessed a growing popularity of these parties since the 1980s and that this growth in popularity is mirrored by a declining popularity of the more traditional political parties.



Populists argue that they despise the political system of representative politics itself [@taggart2000populism].
Moreover, populists are characterised being against the political establishment, the economic, media and cultural elite. Each of them are portrayed as one homogeneous corrupt group acting against the ‘general will’ of citizens [@mudde2017populism]. Therefore populism tends to develop an inner group working against the corrupt others.  As Mudde and Kaltwasser elaborate furthermore, *“This anti-elitist impetus goes together with a critique of institutions such as political parties, big organizations, and bureaucracies, which are accused of distorting the ‘truthful’ links between populist leaders and ‘the common people’”* [@mudde2017populism]. It is emphasized that voters of populist parties do not trust the political system they live in, neither are they satisfied with representative democracy in their country. Populism may be broadly defined as *“a general protest against the checks and balances introduced to prevent ‘the people’s’ direct rule”* [@pelinka2013right]. Summarizing, we can observe the great accordance of scholars, that populist electorate is not supporting the political system and wants to rebel against the established structures.



Recent events showed that numerous citizens are hesitant to further European integration and in the political arena, numerous parties air euro-criticism [@de2009taking]. On the radical right, parties successfully mobilize national identity considerations against the European Union [@hooghe2005calculation], @lubbers2008regarding]. In the 2009 European Parliamentary elections, especially radical right-wing parties mobilized anti-EU sentiment and gained seats in the European parliament. These parties see the foundation of a political European Union as a threat to the sovereignty of the nation state: nearly all radical right-wing parties agree that the EU is bad and should be either reformed fundamentally or abolished [@mudde2007populist]. Yet, the relationship between euro-scepticism and radical right-wing voting behaviour has received little empirical attention in previous studies. @ivarsflaten2005vulnerable showed that euro-scepticism is an important determinant for radical right-wing support in France and Denmark. @van2005some also found a positive relationship between anti-EU sentiments and radical right-wing voting in France. Using data from 2002, @lubbers2007euro focused on the role of euro-scepticism for radical right-wing support in national elections in 13 countries. They found that voting for radical right-wing parties can partly be explained by euro-scepticism, over and beyond other relevant socio-political attitudes. Also, @arzheimer2009christian found evidence for the relevance of euro-scepticism, although he was not able to test its effect next to the major predictor of radical right-wing voting: the unfavourable attitudes towards migrants.

### Individual-level Explanations

#### Economic Deprivation

text: what unites right wing populists in western europe
All existing theories of party system evolution, be they inspired by the Downsean economic tradition (Downs, 1957) or by the political sociology tradition of Lipset and Rokkan (1967), agree on one point. They implicitly or explicitly argue that unless there is some sort of societal change that gives rise to a widespread public grievance, a major change in the party system is unlikely to occur.3 Thus, in the most detailed explanation yet of the pattern of party systems evolution in Western Europe, Lipset and Rokkan emphasized the intimate connections between grievances, the expansion of suffrage, and the rise of new parties. 


#### The Protest Vote

This approach builds on a widely accepted idea that radical right-wing parties gain from political protest. From this point of view, voters for these parties are not attracted by their anti-immigrant stances, but express predominantly political dissatisfaction [@mudde2007populist]. Although several studies emphasize that voters not only cast a radical right-wing vote based on political dissatisfaction, the protest proposition explains at least some of the variation in radical right-wing voting [@ivarsflaten2005vulnerable]. We expect people who perceive their socio-economic situation as deprived to oppose established parties. They will be dissatisfied politically, feel more powerless, and are consequently more likely to cast a radical right-wing vote, since parties on the radical right claim to listen to the dissatisfied and oppose government decisions. People who perceive deprivation in their present socio-economic situation are more likely to vote for a radical right-wing party, as they are more dissatisfied politically [@werts2013euro].

#### Ethnic competition theory

Contributors to the ethnic competition theory proposed that ethnic groups sharing similar economic interests are in competition for scarce resources, which induces perceived ethnic threat and intergroup antagonistic attitudes (Coser, 1956; Levine and Campbell, 1972). In most European countries, ethnic out-groups (search for) work particularly in the lowest labour segments, where unemployment levels tend to be higher (Kiehl and Werner, 1999). Social categories that hold similar positions to ethnic minorities perceive more ethnic threat and therefore have stronger exclu- sionary reactions, e.g. voting for radical right-wing parties (Lubbers et al., 2002).

Coffe (2005) and Van der Brug and Fennema (2003) stressed the relevance of more general threat perceptions: deterioration of the living environment will also nourish feelings of threat, particularly among lower social strata that are more likely to live in neighbourhoods with relatively high levels of criminality. Therefore, those people are expected to feel unsafe in their own neighbourhood more often (e.g. Hale, 1996). Moreover, people may feel directly threatened by ethnic minorities, since ethnic groups are overrepresented in criminality statistics (Dagevos and Gijsberts, 2010). Since radical right-wing parties claim to serve the interests of the in-group and suggest that foreigners are related to a variety of problems, these parties may be an attractive option for people from lower social strata.
H1: Lower-educated people, manual workers and unemployed people are more likely to vote for a radical right-wing party, (a) as they experience more ethnic threat, and (b) as their level of subjective victimization is generally higher.

#### Theory of psychological interests

The classic study of the Authoritarian Personality (Adorno et al., 1950) gives another explanation of why lower social strata would be more likely to vote for radical right-wing parties (e.g. Lipset, 1981 [1960]; Falter and Klein, 1994). Its core idea is that the socio-economic position of lower social strata may be characterized by poverty and deprivation, which in turn would create anxiety and frustration. To deal with anxiety and frustration, these particular strata are likely to submit them- selves to strong authorities or strong traditional norms (Scheepers et al., 1990). Radical right-wing parties serve these psychological needs, as these parties empha- size traditional norms and a strong leader (Lubbers et al., 2002).
H2: Lower-educated people, manual workers, unemployed people, as well as people who perceive deprivation in their present socio-economic situation, are more likely to vote for a radical right-wing party, as they favour authoritarian attitudes.




### Political Trust

@buhlmann2006individual : 
The last bundle of resources concerns the individual’s evaluation of the political system. Easton (1965) considers elections an important source of legitimisation. The political system and its representatives obtain the citizens’ support only if the latter are satis ed by the output of the system (decisions and policies). Considering this, the declining turnout could be interpreted as an increasing loss of of the political system’s legitimacy (Schwartz 1973). According to Westle (1990) we can distinguish between short-term (e.g. trust in parliament) and long-term support factors (e.g. satisfaction with the political system). Individual support is an essential, but not suf cient condition of participation: at least some individuals who are satis ed with the functioning of politics do not participate, precisely because things are going well.
In short, we assume the probability of individual electoral participation to be higher the more a person is in possession of the above resources. We furthermore suggest that the differences in cantonal turnout can be explained by different effects of these resources on individual participation in the different cantons.
In addition, we control for age, sex, and confession. With regard to life- cycle effects, it is assumed that younger individuals are more likely to abstain from voting (Kleinhenz 1995). Gender differences, in turn, are seen as both consequences of generation effects and of structural differences (Ballmer-Cao and Sgier 1998). Lastly, in the Swiss case, confession is an important determinant of electoral participation (Wernli 2001).


### Internal Efficacy

@buhlmann2006individual : 
Since Lazarsfeld et al. (1949), socio-economic status (SES) has played a prominent role in explaining both the decision to vote and participation behaviour. Normally, socio-economic status consists of the individual’s educational level, income, and her occupational status. In theory, a high SES leads to a higher propensity to participate in elections, because individuals with high education levels and/or with a high income have more disposable time and a greater capacity to understand political debates (Kleinhenz 1995). This leads not only to greater political interest, but also to a greater probability of participation. Furthermore, wealthy individuals have an interest in contributing to the stability of the political system by participating in it (Wol nger and Rosenstone 1980).
• Political skills are seen as the most important resource of participation (Bühlmann 2006): individuals with a lot of political interest (Campbell et al. 1976; Lazarsfeld et al. 1949) and internal ef cacy (Campbell et al. 1976) make wider use of all the different possibilities of in uencing politics - including electoral participation - than uninterested individuals or persons who do not think they have the ability to participate in politics.2
• Political attitudes play a crucial role in the decision to vote. Since Campbell et al. (1976), party ties have been considered long-term factors which stabilise electoral choices. However, party ties are also important for participation (Dalton et al. 1984). People with only weak, or no party identi cation at all, show a lower propensity to participate in elections (Pattie and Johnston 1998). An important and widely discussed (especially in German political science (Feist 1992))3 factor is the attitude that voting is a civic duty. If participation in elections is seen as the ful lment of one’s duty as a citizen, the propensity to vote increases.
